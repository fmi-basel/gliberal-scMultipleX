### Purpose
- Extracts detailed **shape features** from 3D meshes, including volume, surface area, solidity, concavity, and aspect ratio.
- Optionally calculates **Gaussian curvature** for mesh surfaces and **spherical harmonics** to decompose mesh geometry.
- Outputs feature tables, curvature meshes, and optional harmonic-reconstructed meshes.

### Outputs
1. A **feature table** with extracted mesh measurements, including:
   - Volume, surface area, aspect ratio, concavity, normalized surface area-to-volume ratio, and more.
2. Optional **spherical harmonic coefficients** and reconstruction error (MSE), saved as a separate table.
3. Optional **reconstructed meshes** from spherical harmonics saved as `.stl`.
4. Optional **Gaussian curvature meshes** saved as `.vtp` files in a new `curvature` folder.
5. Optional **convex hull** and **bounding box** meshes saved as `.vtp` files.

### Limitations
- Requires pre-existing **.stl meshes** within the Zarr structure (e.g., generated by the **Surface Mesh Multiscale** task).
- Mesh files must match the **object labels** specified in the ROI table.
- Computational cost increases when enabling **Gaussian curvature** or **spherical harmonics** calculations.
- Mesh quality and accuracy depend on the input segmentation and mesh generation parameters.
