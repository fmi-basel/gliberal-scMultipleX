### Purpose
- Relabels segmentation images and ROI tables in an OME-Zarr dataset based on a pre-calculated **consensus linking table**.
- Aligns object labels across multiplexing rounds to ensure consistency with the consensus object identities.
- Outputs new segmentation images and ROI tables with updated labels.
- Requires a valid **consensus linking table** as input, typically generated by the `Calculate Linking Consensus` task.
- Non-consensus objects are set to background and excluded from the outputs.

### Outputs
- A **new segmentation image** where object labels match the consensus labels.
- A **relabelled ROI table** corresponding to the updated segmentation image, saved with a `_linked` suffix.

### Limitations
- Only supports **single well ROI tables**; multi-ROI processing (e.g., field of view ROIs) is not yet implemented.
- Input segmentation images and ROI tables must match in terms of object labels; inconsistencies will cause errors.
