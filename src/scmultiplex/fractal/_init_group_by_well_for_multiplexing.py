    Finds images for all acquisitions per well.

    Returns the parallelization_list to run `find_registration_consensus`.

        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        reference_acquisition: Which acquisition to register against. Uses the
            OME-NGFF HCS well metadata acquisition keys to find the reference
            acquisition.
