    """Convert 3D segmentations into 2D MIP segmentations.

    This task loads the 3D segmentation, projects it along the z-axis, and
    stores it into the 2D MIP OME-Zarr image.

    If the 2D & 3D OME-Zarr images
    have different suffixes in their name, use `image_suffix_3D_to_remove` &
    `image_suffix_2D_to_add`. If their base names are different, this task
    does not support processing them at the moment.

    It makes the assumption that the 3D OME-Zarrs are stored in the same place
    as the 2D OME-Zarrs (same based folder).

    Args:
        zarr_url: Path or url to the individual OME-Zarr image to be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        label_name: Name of the label to copy from 3D OME-Zarr to
            2D OME-Zarr
        new_label_name: Optionally overwriting the name of the label in
            the 2D OME-Zarr
        level: Level of the 3D OME-Zarr label to copy from. Valid choices are
            "0", "1", etc. (depending on which levels are available in the
            OME-Zarr label).
        plate_suffix: Suffix that needs to be added to 3D OME-Zarr name to
            generate the path to the 2D OME-Zarr. If the 2D OME-Zarr is
            "/path/to/my_plate_mip.zarr/B/03/0" and the 3D OME-Zarr is located
            in "/path/to/my_plate.zarr/B/03/0", the correct suffix is "_mip".
        image_suffix_3D_to_remove: If the image name between 2D & 3D don't
            match, this is the suffix that should be removed from the 3D image.
            If the 3D image is in "/path/to/my_plate.zarr/B/03/
            0_registered" and the 2D image is in "/path/to/my_plate_mip.zarr/
            B/03/0", the value should be "_registered"
        image_suffix_2D_to_add: If the image name between 2D & 3D don't
            match, this is the suffix that should be added to the 2D image.
            If the 3D image is in "/path/to/my_plate.zarr/B/03/0" and the
            2D image is in "/path/to/my_plate_mip.zarr/B/03/0_illum_corr", the
            value should be "_illum_corr".
        overwrite: If `True`, overwrite existing label and ROI tables in the
            3D OME-Zarr
