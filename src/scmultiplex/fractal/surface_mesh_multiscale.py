    Calculate 3D surface mesh of parent object (e.g. tissue, organoid)
    from 3D cell-level segmentation of children (e.g. nuclei)

    Recommended to run on child objects that have been filtered to remove debris and disconnected components
    (e.g. following cleanup_3d_segmentation task)

    This task consists of 4 parts:

    1. Load the sub-object (e.g. nuc) segmentation images for each object of a given reference round; skip other rounds.
        Select sub-objects (e.g. nuc) that belong to parent object region by masking by parent.
    2. Perform label fusion and edge detection to generate surface label image.
    3. Calculate surface mesh of label image using vtkDiscreteFlyingEdges3D algorithm. Smoothing is applied with
        vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter and tuned with 4 task parameters: passband, smoothing_iterations, feature_angle,
        polynomial_degree (minimal effect).
        The number of triangles in the mesh is optionally reduced with vtkQuadricDecimation filter to form a good
        approximation to the original geometry and is tuned with task parameter target_reduction.
    4. Output: save the (1) meshes (.stl) per object id in meshes folder and (2) well label map as a new label in zarr.
        Note that label map output may be clipped for objects that are dense and have overlapping pixels.
        In this case, the 'winning' object in the overlap region is the one with higher label id.

    Args:
        zarr_url: Path or url to the individual OME-Zarr image to be processed.
            Refers to the zarr_url of the reference acquisition.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        init_args: Intialization arguments provided by
            `init_group_by_well_for_multiplexing`. It contains the
            zarr_url_list listing all the zarr_urls in the same well as the
            zarr_url of the reference acquisition that are being processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        label_name: Label name of segmentation for which mesh is calculated. When Multiscale = True, this is the label
            name of child objects (e.g. nuclei) that will be used for multiscale surface estimation.
        group_by: Label name of segmentated objects that are parents of label_name. If None (default), no grouping
            is applied and meshes are calculated for the input object (label_name).
            Instead, if a group_by label is specified, the
            label_name objects will be masked and grouped by this object. For example, when group_by = 'org', the
            nuclear segmentation is masked by the organoid parent and all nuclei belonging to the parent are loaded
            as a label image. Thus, when Multiscale = False, the calculated mesh contains multiple child objects. When
            Multiscale = True, a new labelmap is generated as a result of child fusion to generate the
            3D parent (organoid-level) shape.
        roi_table: Name of the ROI table used to iterate over objects and load object regions. If group_by = None, this
            is the ROI table that corresponds to the label_name objects. If group_by is passed, this is the ROI table
            for the group_by objects, e.g. org_ROI_table.
        multiscale: if True, a new labelmap is generated as a result of child fusion to generate the
            3D parent (organoid-level) shape. This label output is called {group_by}_from_{label_name},
            with corresponding ROI table name {group_by}_ROI_table_from_{label_name}. This label image is
            optionally saved as a mesh if save_mesh = True. If Multiscale = False, no multiscale label map computation
            is performed and a smoothened mesh of the input label_name is generated.
        save_mesh: if True, calculates and saves mesh on disk in the 'meshes' folder within zarr structure. Meshes
            saved as '.stl', except for the case of multi-object meshed (e.g. multiple nuclei within a parent organoid)
            that are saved as '.vtp' to preserve label ID information. Filename corresponds to parent object label id,
            or to label id in the case when group_by = None.
        expandby_factor: only used if Multiscale = True. Multiplier that specifies pixels by which to expand each
            nuclear mask for merging, float in range [0, 1 or higher], e.g. 0.2 means that 20% of mean of
            nuclear equivalent diameter is used.
        sigma_factor: only used if Multiscale = True. Float that specifies sigma (standard deviation, in pixels)
            for Gaussian kernel used for blurring to smoothen label image prior to edge detection.
            Higher values correspond to more blurring. Recommended range 5-15.
        canny_threshold: only used if Multiscale = True. Image values below this threshold are set to 0 after
            Gaussian blur. float in range [0,1]. Higher values result in tighter fit of mesh to nuclear surface.
        mask_contour_by_parent: if True, the final multiscale edges are masking by 2D parent object mask. Can be used
            to define cleaner edge borders between touching organoids, but may crop surface mask if higher
            blurring is desired.
        fill_holes: if True, the label image just prior to meshing has holes filled by iterating
            over slices. Useful for filling lumens in segmentation.
        filter_by_object_volume: if True, the label image is filtered by volume. This skips objects with lower
            volume (number of pixels, calculated after all processing and hole filling, if applied)
            than the object_volume_filter_threshold.
        object_volume_filter_threshold: Integer threshold for object volume filtering. Number of pixels. E.g. if
            set to 600, objects with a pixel count less than 600 are skipped. Only used if filter_by_object_volume
            is True.
        filter_children_by_volume: if True, performing volume filtering of nuclei to remove objects smaller
            than specified volume_filter_threshold.
        child_volume_filter_threshold: Multiplier that specifies cutoff for volumes below which nuclei are filtered out,
            float in range [0,1], e.g. 0.05 means that 5% of median of nuclear volume distribution is used as cutoff.
            Specify this value if volume filtering is desired. Default 0.05.
        polynomial_degree: Mesh smoothing parameter. The number of polynomial degrees during surface mesh smoothing with
            vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter determines the maximum number of smoothing passes.
            This number corresponds to the degree of the polynomial that is used to approximate the windowed sinc
            function. Usually 10-20 iteration are sufficient. Higher values have little effect on smoothing.
            For further details see VTK vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter documentation.
        passband: Mesh smoothing parameter. Float in range [0,2] that specifies the PassBand for the windowed sinc
            filter in vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter during mesh smoothing. Lower passband values produce more
            smoothing, due to filtering of higher frequencies. For further details see
            VTK vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter documentation.
        feature_angle: Mesh smoothing parameter. Integer in range [0,180] that specifies the feature angle for sharp
            edge identification used for vtk FeatureEdgeSmoothing. Higher values result in more smoothened
            edges in mesh. For further details see VTK vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter documentation.
        target_reduction: Mesh decimation parameter. Float in range [0,1].
            Target reduction is used during mesh decimation via
            vtkQuadricDecimation to reduce the number of triangles in a triangle mesh, forming a good approximation to
            the original geometry. Values closer to 1 indicate larger reduction and smaller mesh file size. Note that
            target_reduction is expressed as the fraction of the original number of triangles in mesh and so is
            proportional to original mesh size. Note the actual reduction may be less depending on triangulation and
            topological constraints. For further details see VTK vtkQuadricDecimation documentation.
        smoothing_iterations:  Mesh smoothing parameter.
            The number of iterations that mesh smoothing and decimation is run.
            If smoothing_iterations > 1, the decimated result is used as input for subsequent smoothing rounds.
            Recommended to start with 1 iteration and increase if resulting smoothing is insufficient. For each
            iteration after the first, the passband is reduced and feature_angle is increased incrementally to
            enhance smoothing. Specifically, the passband is reduced by factor 1/(2^n),
            and the feature_angle is increased by an increment of (5 * n), where n = iteration round (n=0
            is the first iteration). The target_reduction is fixed to 0.1 smoothing_iterations > 1.
            For example if user inputs (0.01, 160, 0.98) for (passband, feature_angle, target_reduction), the second
            iteration will use parameters (0.005, 165, 0.1), the third (0.0025, 170, 0.1), etc. Maximum feature_angle
            is capped at 180. Note that additional iterations usually do not significantly add to processing time as
            the number of mesh verteces is typically significantly reduced after the first decimation iteration.
