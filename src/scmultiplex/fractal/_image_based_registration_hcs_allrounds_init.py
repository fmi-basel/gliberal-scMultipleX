    Initialized calculate registration task

    Same as _image_based_registration_hcs_init.py only does not exclude reference round in zarr_url list;
    all rounds are processed.

    Args:
        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        reference_acquisition: Which acquisition to register against. Needs to
            match the acquisition metadata in the OME-Zarr image.

    Returns:
        task_output: Dictionary for Fractal server that contains a
            parallelization list.
